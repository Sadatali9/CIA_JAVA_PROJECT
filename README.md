# CIA_JAVA_PROJECT
"This project utilizes deep file system manipulation techniques and integrates cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms to ensure data protection and to provide a robust and secure infrastructure."
# Notes
1. Place the database folder in your computer and accordimgly ensure to replace file paths in the code to match your local directory structure.
2. The Main.java file is the entry point for the CLI program.
